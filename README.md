For this project (done as part of The Odin Project Javascript Course) I needed to make a library application that allows you to add and remove books from the library, in addition to allowing you to change the read status for a given book.

I added a bit more functionality than was required and made a page that should hopefully be responsive and easy to use. To add books click the '+' card at the bottom of the page. To edit a given book click the pen icon for the corresponding book card. To delete a book, click the delete button for the corresponding book card (bottom right of the book card).

The page should should hopefully work OK on mobile or tablet (in addition to working fine on desktop). I don't expect it to be very accessible though (I will be covering accessible design in a later course).

The page can be viewed via the following link: https://rednaxelam.github.io/library/.
